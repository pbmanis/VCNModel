Notes on installation 8/10/2021

1. Neuronvis needs to be on branch Python3
2. Montager name -> Montage. Need to fix or remove the montager - as is not used.
3. Data table .xls in VCN-SBEM-Data/MorphologyData/VCN. needs to be mapped into place
4. .matplotlib/figures.mplstyle - can we remove this? 

The standard installation involves creating a local environment that has all of the 
components needed for the modeling runs. This is done by running the bash/zsh script
"make_env.sh"  This will download and install the specified
versions of the modules, and create a basic working environment (with black, isort, 
jupyter lab, spyder, etc.). 

The script will also run the basic tests on cnmodel, install cochlea, and compile all the Neuron
mechanisms that are used.

Paths specific to your system will need to be adjusted in "wheres_my_data.py". 
A few of the scripts in the vcnmodel.util directory have hard-coded paths, which 
will need to be changed as well if you are running them. These currently include:
vcnmodel/plotters/Figure2_Supp1.py
vcnmodel/plotters/Figure7_Supplement1.py
vcnmodel/util/compare_hoc.py
vcnmodel/util/inspect_simulation_file.py
(vcnmodel/utilmake_shared_dataset.py also has hard-coded paths, but this is used only
for making an archive of the simulation results for distriution.)
