VCN Modeling from SBEM data

Data/software locations:

/Desktop/Python/CalyxModel
(using pre-Campagnola code for simulations)
/VCN_Cells
/VCN_c08
/VCN_c18



model_run.py

Run a model based on a hoc structure, decorating the structure with ion channels and synapses.

Directory structure:
VCN_Cells/   # top level for data
    cell_ID/    # VCN_c18, for example (first argument in call should be this directory name)
        MorphologyFiles/  # location for swc and hoc files
            VCN_c18_755V2.hoc (cell body scaled version)
            VCN_c18_755.hoc  (unscaled version)
            misc.swc  (various swc files that were translated to hoc files)
        InitializationFiles/  # location for Init files
            IV/  # initialization for just the IV with no synaptic input
                VCN_c18_755v2.ninit  # different base structures
                VCN_c18755.ninit
            AN/  # initialization for synaptic inputs
                (ditto)  # different base structures of input arrangements
        Simulations/
            IV/  # results from IV simulations
            AN/  # results from AN simulations
         
Usage:
Simulate activity in a reconstructed model cell
