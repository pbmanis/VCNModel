"""
    Vector strength for models with SAM tones, different input configurations.
    17 Aug 2021 version.
    Results are a printout from DataTablesVCN after selecting the data runs.
Run started at: 2023-04-04-14.12.06
WARNING: This table is automatically written by figures.py generate_VS_data_file
       and should not be directly edited.
To Regenerate:
   After running the simulationns, select the runs to be added.
   Use the 'Print File Info' button for each cells
    Copy the text in the 'Reports' dock in DataTablesVCN
  into a 'VS_datasets_xxdB.py' file, where xx is the sound pressure level.
Then select 'VS-SAMTone-no figure' in DataTables, and 'Create Figure.
  No figure will be generated, but vector strength will be calculated
   and the VS_data_xxdB.py file will be created.
The VS_data_xxdB.py file holds all of the vector-strength information, in a text format,
   and is read by the plotting programs.
