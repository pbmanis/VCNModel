    17 Aug 2021 version (added rMTF data 4 April 2023).
    Results are a printout from DataTablesVCN after selecting the data runs.

WARNING: This table is automatically written by figures.py generate_VS_data_file
       and should not be directly edited.
To Regenerate:
   After running the simulationns, enter the filenames into VS_datasets_xxdB.py
   You can select the datasets, and then click the 'Print File Info' button for each cell.
    Copy the text in the 'Reports' dock in DataTablesVCN
  into a 'VS_datasets_xxdB.py' file, where xx is the sound pressure level.
Then select 'Analyze VS-SAM Table @ xxdB DPL' in DataTables Figures dropdown, and click 'Create Figure.
  No figure will be generated, but vector strength will be calculated
   and the VS_data_xxdB (timestanp).py file will be created.
The VS_data_xxdB.py file holds all of the vector-strength information, in a text format,
   and is read by the plotting programs.
