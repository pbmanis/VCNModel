Figures
=======

For some figures, the data to be plotted is collected manually using the "print file info" in DataTablesVCN.py, 
under the Tools bar. The results of the analysis or the files selected are printed into the lower "reporting" window on the right,
where they may be copied out to the appropriate tables in either "vcnmodel/plotting/figure_data.py" or "vs_datasets.py"

Figure files are sent in PDF format to the "VCN-SBEM-Data/Figures" directory (or the directory specified in "wheres_my_data.toml"),
which should be outside of the code repository. The numbering is sequential, and parts of these individual files are reassembled in Illustrator to generate the main figures; others are summaries that
are presented as supplemental data.
